Composer: Because using external Libraries should be Fun!
=========================================================

Welcome to the brand new world of PHP with Composer! 

One of the great things about PHP is that we're huge! But how big are we really?
PHP consists of a lot of successful, but extremely isolated libraries, like
Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and all of the PHP frameworks like Symfony and Zend.
Historically, these different groups share almost nothing, which means that
in reality, we're all pretty small islands. That's right, even though we're
the biggest group in the world, we've somehow turned ourselves into the underdogs.

Well, it's time for a whole new beautiful era where your community is *all*
of the PHP world.

PHP developers haven't typically shared code or used outside libraries because,
well, it sucked! To use just one outside library, you'd need to tackle at
least three major issues:

1) First, how do I `autoload`_ the PHP classes in the library? Autoloading is
the background machine that makes it possible to reference PHP classes without
using ``require`` or ``include`` statements. When I bring in outside code, I
either need to figure out which files to include or how to configure that
library's autoloader.

2) Second, we need to know if this library depends on any other libraries.
And if it does, that's yet another library I need to download and configure.

3) Finally, how should I store the library in my project? Should I use SVN
externals? Git submodules? Just commit the whole darn thing into my project?

The answer to these 3 problems is Composer. Want to do something crazy like
bring Symfony's Finder component into a Drupal project? We're about to learn
just how easy that is. But wait! Before you non-Drupal people run off, the
process and code you'll see have nothing to do with Drupal. This is one of
the first great things about using Composer: the process for using external
libraries is the same now in *any* PHP project.

Our Project
-----------

Move into the directory where your project lives. Our first goal is to use
a standalone Symfony component called "Finder" to list all the files in a
directory and print them onto the page. Just to make things really exciting,
we're going to do this inside a custom Drupal module. 

To start, I've created a function called ``get_current_files`` deep inside
my project, which returns an array of filenames:: 

    // sites/all/modules/list_files/list_files.module
    // ...
    
    function get_current_files()
    {
        return array('foo');
    }

.. tip::

    I've already created a module called ``list_files`` and enabled it before
    starting the tutorial.

I've also gone far enough to print these onto the screen. Ok great, now let's
get to work!

Installation
------------

The first thing you'll need to do is download the Composer executable. Go
to `GetComposer.org`_, click "Download", then copy one of the two code blocks
depending if you have ``curl`` installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Composer itself is just an executable file, and this fancy bit of code downloads
the file and makes sure your system is setup to use Composer. If you see any
errors or warnings during this step, you may need to tweak your PHP configuration.

If everything went ok, you'll have a brand new ``composer.phar`` sitting at
the root of your project. Ok, let's put this guy to work! Execute the composer
script by typing ``php composer.phar``:

    $ php composer.phar

This shows you a list of all the available composer commands: we'll get to 
know some of these in the next few minutes.

Creating the composer.json File
-------------------------------

So far, we have a ``composer.phar``, but that's it! Composer's main job is
to download third-party libraries into a ``vendor/`` directory in your project.
To tell Composer which libraries you need, your project needs to have a ``composer.json``
configuration file. Instead of creating this file by hand, let's use the first
Composer command: ``init``.

    $ php composer.phar init

The ``init`` command will ask you several questions about your project, but
unless you're planning to open-source it, don't worry too much about your
answers. Finally, it'll ask you to interactively define your dependencies.
By "dependencies", Composer is asking you which third-party libraries you
want to include in your project. To start, we're going to add a Symfony2
component called Finder - and you can find its documentation at `symfony.com`.

At the prompt, simply type "finder" and wait for the results. Behind the
scenes, Composer is searching against a giant central repository of packages
called "Packagist", which you can search directly at `packagist.org`_. In the
language of Composer, a package is just an individual directory that you
want to download into your project. A typical package contains PHP classes,
but it can really contain anything.

Each package has a unique name, and your first job is to find the name of
the one you need. Ideally, the name is included in the documentation for
the library, but even if its not, you can often find it just by searching.
On Packagist, searching for "finder" reveals a package called ``symfony/finder``,
which is definitely the right one!

Back at the terminal, our search for "finder" has returned a bunch of results
including many versions of ``symfony/finder``. The second thing we need to
figure out is which version we want. The safest choice is to choose the latest
stable release, which should follow the X.X.X format. In our case, this is
``v2.1.2``. If a version ends in ``-dev``, it's a development branch, which
may be stable or unstable based on the library. The ``dev-master`` version
is special, and it always means the latest, bleeding-edge code. If you use
a lesser-known package, ``dev-master`` may be your only option.

Let's choose to install ``v2.1.2``. When it asks you to install "dev dependencies"
interactively, choose no. You probably won't need to worry about dev dependencies,
but if you're curious about them, check out `Composer's documentation`_. Finally,
confirm generation and add ``vendor/`` to your ``.gitignore`` file if you're
storing your project with git:

.. code-block:: text

    # .gitignore
    /vendor/

The end-product of the ``init`` command is the new ``composer.json`` file
that's now in your project. Open it and check out the ``require`` key: this
is really the only important part of this file right now and it simply tells
Composer which packages your project needs. We could have created this file
by hand - the ``init`` task is just there for convenience.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "weaverryan/drupal",
        "require": {
            "symfony/finder": "v2.1.2"
        },
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "Ryan Weaver",
                "email": "ryan@thatsquality.com"
            }
        ]
    }

Using the "install" command
---------------------------

At this point, we've downloaded the Composer executable and created the
``composer.json`` config file. To actually put Composer to work, run
``php composer.phar install``. This is the most important command: it reads the
``composer.json`` file and downloads all the needed libraries into the vendor
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar install

And look, a vendor directory!

.. code-block:: text

    vendor/
        composer/
        symfony/
            finder/
                Symfony/...

It contains a symfony directory that holds the Finder library and a few other
things that help with autoloading - which is one of the most powerful features
of Composer.

Autoloading
-----------

Now that Composer has downloaded the Finder library, let's use it! To keep
things simple, I'll paste in some Finder code that looks for all gif files
that have been modified within the past day::

    // sites/all/modules/list_files/list_files.module
    // ...

    /**
     * A utility function to return the array of current SplFileInfo objects
     */
    function get_current_files()
    {
        // the "files" directory
        $dir = drupal_realpath(file_default_scheme() . '://');

        $finder = new \Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder();
        $finder->in($dir)
            ->name('*.gif')
            ->date('since 1 day ago')
        ;
        $files = array();
        foreach ($finder as $file) {
            $files[] = $file->getFilename();
        }

        return $files;
    }

This code should work, but when we refresh the page, we get a class not found
error!

.. highlights::

    Class Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder not found.

Of course! Even though Composer downloaded the Finder library for us, we
can't use any of its PHP classes without including them.

Fortunately, Composer solves this for us - through autoloading. The exact
details of how autoloading works goes beyond this screencast, but the important
thing is that Composer helps us out. To use Composer's autoloader, simply
include the ``vendor/autoload.php`` file somewhere in your project. For now,
let's put it right inside this function::

    // sites/all/modules/list_files/list_files.module
    // ...

    function get_current_files()
    {
        require __DIR__.'/../../../../vendor/autoload.php';

        // ...
    }

Refresh the page again. It works! By including Composer's autoloader, the
Finder library - as well as the PHP classes for any other libraries we included
via Composer - are made available to us automatically.

To make our third-party classes available anywhere, it would be even better
to include the autoload file in some central, bootstrap file in your project.
For Drupal, this might be the ``settings.php`` file::

    // sites/default/settings.php
    require __DIR__.'/../../vendor/autoload.php';

    // ... the rest of the file

When we refresh, everything still works.

The composer.lock file and "install" versus "update"
----------------------------------------------------

Things are going so well that I think we should add another library! So let's
get crazy! Head back to packagist.org and find a library ``symfony/filesystem``.
To tell Composer that we want this package, just edit the ``composer.json``
by hand, add a second entry under the ``require`` with the name of the library.
To make things more interesting, let's use the ``2.1.x-dev`` version, which
will give us the latest commit on the 2.1 branch:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "weaverryan/drupal",
        "require": {
            "symfony/finder": "v2.1.2",
            "symfony/filesystem": "2.1.x-dev"
        },
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "Ryan Weaver",
                "email": "ryan@thatsquality.com"
            }
        ]
    }

Next, we need to tell Composer to re-read this file and download the new library.

Before, we used the ``install`` command to do this. But if you try that command
now, it prints out a few lines, but doesn't actually do anything. Why not?

.. code-block:: bash

    # does not download the new library :/
    $ php composer.phar install

When it comes to downloading the libraries we need, composer actually has two
different commands: ``install`` and ``update``.

When we ran the ``install`` command earlier, one of the things it did was
create a ``composer.lock`` file that recorded the exact versions of all libraries
that it downloaded at that exact moment.

Normally, the ``install`` command actually ignores the ``composer.json`` file
and reads all of the information from this lock file instead. If you make a
change to ``composer.json`` and run ``php composer.phar install``, that change
won't be used. The lock file is important, because if multiple developers are
using a project, each one can run ``php composer.phar install`` and receive
identical versions of all libraries, even if new commits have been added
to them.

In fact, the *only* time that the ``install`` command reads the ``composer.json``
file is when you first start the project, because the lock file doesn't exist yet.

In this one case, ``install`` acts exactly like the ``update`` command, which
always ignores the lock file and reads the ``composer.json`` file instead. This
checks and potentially upgrades all the libraries in ``composer.json`` and updates
``composer.lock`` when it finishes.

What this ultimately means is that you should use a simple workflow. Unless
you're adding a new library or intentionally upgrading something, always use
``composer.phar install``.

Using the update Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you *do* need to add a new library or upgrade something. Use ``composer.phar update``.
You can be even more precise by calling ``update`` and passing it the name of
the library you're updating. By doing this, Composer will only update *that*
library, instead of all of them.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar update symfony/filesystem

Icing in the Cake: The require Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also, Composer has a cool shortcut command for adding new libraries into your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar require 

.. tip::

    You can use the require command to search for a library. In this example,
    I searched for the ``doctrine/dbal`` package and added it.

With the ``require`` command, you can search for the package you need and Composer
will automatically update your ``composer.json`` for you *and* run the ``update``
command to download the library. In this case, when I included the ``doctrine/dbal``
package, an extra packaged called ``doctrine/common`` was downloaded. This is
dependency management in action. Composer is smart enough to know that ``doctrine/dbal``
depends on ``doctrine/common`` and it downloads it for you. Woo!

Version Control
---------------

The lock file is especially important if you have multiple developers so
that you can be sure that each person has identical vendor libraries. To make
this possible, commit both your composer.json file *and* your ``composer.lock``
file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git add composer.json
    $ git add composer.lock
    $ git add .gitignore
    $ git add sites

Typically ``composer.phar`` is ignored, since each developer can download it
individually.

Now, let's pretend like we're a new developer that's pulling down the codebase.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ..
    $ git clone drupal drupal2
    $ cd drupal2

Notice that the project doesn't have a ``vendor/`` directory yet, because we
didn't commit the vendor files. In fact, we ignored the ``vendor`` directory
in git, because Composer can populate it for us.

I'll copy in the ``composer.phar`` file from the previous directory and then
run ``php composer.phar install``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp ../drupal/composer.phar .
    $ php composer.phar install

This reads the ``composer.lock`` file and downloads everything we need into the
``vendor/`` directory. And just like that, your new developer has a functional
project!

Conclusion
----------

There's a lot more that Composer can do, but you already understand how to
find libraries, manage your ``composer.json`` file, use Composer's autoloader
and download the external libraries with the ``update`` or ``install`` commands.

If you'd like to learn more, check out the documentation at `GetComposer.org`_.
One interesting topic is `scripts`_ - which are callbacks that are executed before
or after packages are installed. Other important topics include the `dump-autoload`_
command, "dev dependencies", minimum stability, and installing Composer globally.
